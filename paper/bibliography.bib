abstract = {Flaky tests are software tests that exhibit a seemingly random outcome (pass or fail)
despite exercising unchanged code. In this work, we examine the perceptions of software
developers about the nature, relevance, and challenges of flaky tests. We asked 21
professional developers to classify 200 flaky tests they previously fixed, in terms
of the nature and the origin of the flakiness, as well as of the fixing effort. We
also examined developers' fixing strategies. Subsequently, we conducted an online
survey with 121 developers with a median industrial programming experience of five
years. Our research shows that: The flakiness is due to several different causes,
four of which have never been reported before, despite being the most costly to fix;
flakiness is perceived as significant by the vast majority of developers, regardless
of their team's size and project's domain, and it can have effects on resource allocation,
scheduling, and the perceived reliability of the test suite; and the challenges developers
report to face regard mostly the reproduction of the flaky behavior and the identification
of the cause for the flakiness. Public preprint [http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01466],

abstract = {We present counterintuitive results for the scalability of fuzzing. Given the same
non-deterministic fuzzer, finding the same bugs linearly faster requires linearly
more machines. For instance, with twice the machines, we can find all known bugs in
half the time. Yet, finding linearly more bugs in the same time requires exponentially
more machines. For instance, for every new bug we want to find in 24 hours, we might
need twice more machines. Similarly for coverage. With exponentially more machines,
we can cover the same code exponentially faster, but uncovered code only linearly
faster. In other words, re-discovering the same vulnerabilities is cheap but finding
new vulnerabilities is expensive. This holds even under the simplifying assumption
of no parallelization overhead. We derive these observations from over four CPU years
worth of fuzzing campaigns involving almost three hundred open source programs, two
state-of-the-art greybox fuzzers, four measures of code coverage, and two measures
of vulnerability discovery. We provide a probabilistic analysis and conduct simulation
experiments to explain this phenomenon.},

software. Recently, researchers have devoted significant effort to devising new fuzzing
techniques, strategies, and algorithms. Such new ideas are primarily evaluated experimentally
so an important question is: What experimental setup is needed to produce trustworthy
results? We surveyed the recent research literature and assessed the experimental
evaluations carried out by 32 fuzzing papers. We found problems in every evaluation
we considered. We then performed our own extensive experimental evaluation using an
existing fuzzer. Our results showed that the general problems we found in existing
experimental evaluations can indeed translate to actual wrong or misleading assessments.
We conclude with some guidelines that we hope will help improve experimental evaluations
of fuzz testing algorithms, making reported results more robust.},

abstract = { Among the major questions that a practicing tester faces are deciding where to focus
additional testing effort, and deciding when to stop testing. Test the least-tested
code, and stop when all code is well-tested, is a reasonable answer. Many measures
of "testedness" have been proposed; unfortunately, we do not know whether these are
truly effective. In this paper we propose a novel evaluation of two of the most important
and widely-used measures of test suite quality. The first measure is statement coverage,
the simplest and best-known code coverage measure. The second measure is mutation
score, a supposedly more powerful, though expensive, measure. We evaluate these measures
using the actual criteria of interest: if a program element is (by these measures)
well tested at a given point in time, it should require fewer future bug-fixes than
a "poorly tested" element. If not, then it seems likely that we are not effectively
measuring testedness. Using a large number of open source Java programs from Github
and Apache, we show that both statement coverage and mutation score have only a weak
negative correlation with bug-fixes. Despite the lack of strong correlation, there
are statistically and practically significant differences between program elements
for various binary criteria. Program elements (other than classes) covered by any
test case see about half as many bug-fixes as those not covered, and a similar line
can be drawn for mutation score thresholds. Our results have important implications
for both software engineering practice and research evaluation. },

abstract = {Raw lines of code (LOC) is a metric that does not, at first glance, seem extremely useful for automated test generation. It is both highly language-dependent and not extremely meaningful, semantically, within a language: one coder can produce the same effect with many fewer lines than another. However, relative LOC, between components of the same project, turns out to be a highly useful metric for automated testing. In this article, we make use of a heuristic based on LOC counts for tested functions to dramatically improve the effectiveness of automated test generation. This approach is particularly valuable in languages where collecting code coverage data to guide testing has a very high overhead. We apply the heuristic to property-based Python testing using the TSTL (Template Scripting Testing Language) tool. In our experiments, the simple LOC heuristic can improve branch and statement coverage by large margins (often more than 20%, up to 40% or more) and improve fault detection by an even larger margin (usually more than 75% and up to 400% or more). The LOC heuristic is also easy to combine with other approaches and is comparable to, and possibly more effective than, two well-established approaches for guiding random testing.},

The tool implements mutation operators that are specifically designed for functional programs, and makes use of the type system of Haskell to achieve a more relevant set of mutants than otherwise possible. Mutation coverage is particularly valuable for functional programs due to highly compact code, referential transparency, and clean semantics; these make augmenting a test suite or specification based on surviving mutants a practical method for improved testing.},

FitSpec tests mutant variations of functions under test against a given property set, recording any surviving mutants that pass all tests. The number of surviving mutants and any smallest survivor are presented to the user. A surviving mutant indicates incompleteness of the property set, prompting the user to amend a property or to add a new one, making the property set stronger. Based on the same test results, FitSpec also provides conjectures in the form of equivalences and implications between property subsets. These conjectures help the user to identify minimal core subsets of properties and so to reduce the cost of future property-based testing.},

abstract = { The coverage of a test suite is often used as a proxy for its ability to detect faults. However, previous studies that investigated the correlation between code coverage and test suite effectiveness have failed to reach a consensus about the nature and strength of the relationship between these test suite characteristics. Moreover, many of the studies were done with small or synthetic programs, making it unclear whether their results generalize to larger programs, and some of the studies did not account for the confounding influence of test suite size. In addition, most of the studies were done with adequate suites, which are are rare in practice, so the results may not generalize to typical test suites. We have extended these studies by evaluating the relationship between test suite size, coverage, and effectiveness for large Java programs. Our study is the largest to date in the literature: we generated 31,000 test suites for five systems consisting of up to 724,000 lines of source code. We measured the statement coverage, decision coverage, and modified condition coverage of these suites and used mutation testing to evaluate their fault detection effectiveness. We found that there is a low to moderate correlation between coverage and effectiveness when the number of test cases in the suite is controlled for. In addition, we found that stronger forms of coverage do not provide greater insight into the effectiveness of the suite. Our results suggest that coverage, while useful for identifying under-tested parts of a program, should not be used as a quality target because it is not a good indicator of test suite effectiveness. },

abstract = {In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the art of computer programming,
the conceptual tools available for the design of programs, and the prevention of programming
oversights and error. The initial outstanding contribution to our understanding of
this subject was made by E. W. Dijkstra, whose Notes on Structured Programming form
the first and major section of this book. They clearly expound the reflections of
a brilliant programmer on the methods which he has hitherto unconsciously applied;
there can be no programmer of the present day who could not increase his skills by
a study and conscious application of these principles.In the second monograph I have
tried to describe how similar principles can be applied in the design of data structures.
I have suggested that in analysing a problem and groping towards a solution, a programmer
should take advantage of abstract concepts such as sets, sequences, and mappings;
and judiciously postpone decisions on representation until he is constructing the
more detailed code of the program. The monograph also describes a range of useful
ideas for data representation, and suggests the criteria relevant for their selection.The
third monograph provides a synthesis of the previous two, and expounds the close theoretical
and practical connections between the design of data and the design of programs. It
introduces useful additional methods for program and data structuring which may be
unfamiliar to many programmers. The examples show that structured programming principles
can be equally applied in "bottom-up" as in "top-down" program design. The original
inspiration, insight, and all the examples were contributed by O.-J. Dahl; I have
only assembled the material, and added some additional explanations where I found
it difficult to understand.}

quality -- its ability to find faults. The most common approach is to use code coverage
as a measure for test suite quality, and diminishing returns in coverage or high absolute
coverage as a stopping rule. In testing research, suite quality is often evaluated
by a suite's ability to kill mutants (artificially seeded potential faults). Determining
which criteria best predict mutation kills is critical to practical estimation of
test suite quality. Previous work has only used small sets of programs, and usually
compares multiple suites for a single program. Practitioners, however, seldom compare
suites --- they evaluate one suite. Using suites (both manual and automatically generated)
from a large set of real-world open-source projects shows that evaluation results
differ from those for suite-comparison: statement (not block, branch, or path) coverage
predicts mutation kills best. },

Unfortunately, current automated mutation analysis systems suffer from severe performance problems. This paper presents a new method for performing mutation analysis that uses program schemata to encode all mutants for a program into one metaprogram, which is subsequently compiled and run at speeds substantially higher than achieved by previous interpretive systems. Preliminary performance improvements of over 300% are reported. This method has the additional advantages of being easier to implement than interpretive systems, being simpler to port across a wide range of hardware and software platforms, and using the same compiler and run-time support system that is used during development and/or deployment.},

abstract = {Mutation analysis can provide valuable insights into both the system under test and its test suite. However, it is not scalable due to the cost of building and testing a large number of mutants. Predictive Mutation Testing (PMT) has been proposed to reduce the cost of mutation testing, but it can only provide statistical inference about whether a mutant will be killed or not by the entire test suite. We propose Seshat, a Predictive Mutation Analysis (PMA) technique that can accurately predict the entire kill matrix, not just the Mutation Score (MS) of the given test suite. Seshat exploits the natural language channel in code, and learns the relationship between the syntactic and semantic concepts of each test case and the mutants it can kill, from a given kill matrix. The learnt model can later be used to predict the kill matrices for subsequent versions of the program, even after both the source and test code have changed significantly. Empirical evaluation using the programs in Defects4J shows that Seshat can predict kill matrices with an average F-score of 0.83 for versions that are up to years apart. This is an improvement in F-score by 0.14 and 0.45 points over the state-of-the-art PMT technique and a simple coverage-based heuristic, respectively. Seshat also performs as well as PMT for the prediction of the MS only. When applied to a mutant-based fault localisation technique, the predicted kill matrix by Seshat is successfully used to locate faults within the top 10 position, showing its usefulness beyond prediction of MS. Once Seshat trains its model using a concrete mutation analysis, the subsequent predictions made by Seshat are on average 39 times faster than actual test-based analysis. We also show that Seshat can be successfully applied to automatically generated test cases with an experiment using EvoSuite.},

abstract = {Automated tests play an important role in software evolution because they can rapidly detect faults introduced during changes. In practice, code-coverage metrics are often used as criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of test suites with focus on regression faults. However, code coverage only expresses which portion of a system has been executed by tests, but not how effective the tests actually are in detecting regression faults.Our goal was to evaluate the validity of code coverage as a measure for test effectiveness. To do so, we conducted an empirical study in which we applied an extreme mutation testing approach to analyze the tests of open-source projects written in Java. We assessed the ratio of pseudo-tested methods (those tested in a way such that faults would not be detected) to all covered methods and judged their impact on the software project. The results show that the ratio of pseudo-tested methods is acceptable for unit tests but not for system tests (that execute large portions of the whole system). Therefore, we conclude that the coverage metric is only a valid effectiveness indicator for unit tests.},

abstract = {Pseudo-tested methods are defined as follows: they are covered by the test suite, yet no test case fails when the method body is removed, i.e., when all the effects of this method are suppressed. This intriguing concept was coined in 2016, by Niedermayr and colleagues, who showed that such methods are systematically present, even in well-tested projects with high statement coverage. This work presents a novel analysis of pseudo-tested methods. First, we run a replication of Niedermayr's study with 28K+ methods, enhancing its external validity thanks to the use of new tools and new study subjects. Second, we perform a systematic characterization of these methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively with an extensive manual analysis of 101 pseudo-tested methods. The first part of the study confirms Niedermayr's results: pseudo-tested methods exist in all our subjects. Our in-depth characterization of pseudo-tested methods leads to two key insights: pseudo-tested methods are significantly less tested than the other methods; yet, for most of them, the developers would not pay the testing price to fix this situation. This calls for future work on targeted test generation to specify those pseudo-tested methods without spending developer time.},

abstract = {Everyone wants to know one thing about a test suite: will it detect enough bugs? Unfortunately, in most settings that matter, answering this question directly is impractical or impossible. Software engineers and researchers therefore tend to rely on various measures of code coverage (where mutation testing is considered a form of syntactic coverage). A long line of academic research efforts have attempted to determine whether relying on coverage as a substitute for fault detection is a reasonable solution to the problems of test suite evaluation. This essay argues that the profusion of coverage-related literature is in part a sign of an underlying uncertainty as to what exactly it is that measuring coverage should achieve, as well as how we would know if it can, in fact, achieve it. We propose some solutions and mitigations, but the primary focus of this essay is to clarify the state of current confusions regarding this key problem for effective software testing.},

abstract = {There has been a lot of work to shed light on whether random testing is actually a useful testing technique. Despite its simplicity, several successful real-world applications appear in the literature. Although it is not going to solve all possible testing problems, random testing is an essential tool in the hands of software testers. In this paper, we address general questions about random testing, such as how long random testing needs on average to achieve testing targets (e.g., coverage), how does it scale and how likely is it to yield similar results if we re-run random testing on the same testing problem. Due to its simplicity that makes the mathematical analysis of random testing tractable, we provide precise and rigorous answers to these questions. Our formal results can be applied to most types of software and testing criteria. Simulations are carried out to provide further support to our formal results. The obtained results are then used to assess the validity of empirical analyses reported in the literature. Results show that random testing is more effective and predictable than previously thought.},

abstract = {To find defects in software, one needs test cases that execute the software systematically, and oracles that assess the correctness of the observed behavior when running these test cases. This paper presents EvoSuite, a tool that automatically generates test cases with assertions for classes written in Java code. To achieve this, EvoSuite applies a novel hybrid approach that generates and optimizes whole test suites towards satisfying a coverage criterion. For the produced test suites, EvoSuite suggests possible oracles by adding small and effective sets of assertions that concisely summarize the current behavior; these assertions allow the developer to detect deviations from expected behavior, and to capture the current behavior in order to protect against future defects breaking this behavior.},
